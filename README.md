# Projects
Interesting projects I used to study and practice data analytics techniques.


## Credit Card Approval Prediction Model
**Completed**  

**Goal:** To better understand the process of approving individuals for credit cards and predict what types of individuals are more likely to be approved or rejected.

Built machine learning models using data containing 25,128 observations and 21 variables to evaluate variable importance in credit card approvals to understand what factors are most important when approving credit cards. Models achieved an 85% accuracy in predicting credit card approvals. Presented findings through slides available [here](https://github.com/VincentiusP/Projects/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Approval%20Prediction%20Project/Credic%20Card%20Approval%20Prediction%20Slidedeck.pdf).

Tools Used:  
R - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost

## NY Times Sentiment Analysis Project
**Completed**  

**Goal:** To determine if the NYTimes accurately depicted the state of financial markets through their articles. Does the net sentiment level of articles match that of another indicator of financial performance such as the S&P500?

Conducted sentiment analysis on 1000 articles from the NYTimes using a financial sentiment library. Created time series plots to compare the sentiment coefficient against the S&P 500, demonstrating that the predictive performance of the NYTimes business articles was comparable to the S&P 500. Presented findings through slides available [here](https://github.com/VincentiusP/Projects/blob/main/NYTimes%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Project/NYTimes%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Slides.pdf).

## Sea Level Time Series Forecasting
**Completed**
