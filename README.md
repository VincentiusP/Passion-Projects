Interesting projects I used to study and practice data analytics techniques.


## Credit Card Approval Prediction Model
**Completed**  

Built machine learning models using data containing 25,128 observations and 21 variables to evaluate variable importance in credit card approvals to understand what factors are most important when approving credit cards. Models achieved an 85% accuracy in predicting credit card approvals. Presented findings through slides available [here](https://github.com/VincentiusP/Projects/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Approval%20Prediction%20Project/Credic%20Card%20Approval%20Prediction%20Slidedeck.pdf).
